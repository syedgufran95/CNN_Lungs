# CNN_Lungs
This CNN is trained on a balanced dataset of 424 lung X-Rays (normal and covid-19).  It can be tweaked to any binary image classification . This CNN model has the accuracy of  89.4 % (Can be improved by performing basic image processing).The focus of this project was to collect and arrange images into features that can be later supplied to a machine learning model. Currently working on ways to improve the  accuracy of this model by lung extraction.
I have uploaded the images I found on kaggle and arranged it into two folders ie (covid and normal) with the help of metadata present in the dataset. After that I prepared the training data, which I saved with the help of pickle, if you wish you can directly import the pickle file from this link( https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11YHyGigcTCXcWgXA7puvGsaeA1V-Q160?usp=sharing) and supply this to any ML model.
